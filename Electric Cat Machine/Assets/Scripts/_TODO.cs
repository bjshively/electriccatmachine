// CATS
GrayCat has a single frame for each pose. Not sure how to assign those frames to Animations yet.
TODO: Add script features like Player's to allow falling animation, etc.
TODO: Always eject a cat with the jumping sprite.



// CRATES
TODO: Wood boxes should break when they fall.
The gray tiles in the level are supposed to be "pipes."
TODO: The crate in that area should be assigned to the pipe.
TODO: The pipe should eject a new crate whenever that assigned crate is lost. Pit or destoryed.
